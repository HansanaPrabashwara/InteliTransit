<p class="desc-2">
    The proposed solution introduces a dynamic and responsive system for public transportation that leverages IoT
    technology to address the identified issues. Initially, all vehicles will follow a base schedule to maintain a
    structured framework. To manage peak drives effectively, the solution involves tracking the number of passengers on
    board each public vehicle. As the passenger count approaches capacity, the vehicle is permitted to increase its
    speed, optimizing efficiency. Furthermore, if the first vehicle reaches its passenger limit, the subsequent vehicle
    adjusts its speed to pick up nearby passengers, prioritizing areas with higher demand. Passengers waiting at stops
    can notify vehicles of their presence, influencing the speed of the approaching vehicle based on real-time demand.

    Similarly, to address the issue of passenger-less drives, the system employs a mechanism where vehicles slow down if
    they have fewer passengers than required. The following vehicle adjusts its speed accordingly, promoting a balanced
    distribution of passengers among vehicles. The decision-making process incorporates real-time data on passenger
    counts and waiting passengers, ensuring a responsive and adaptive transportation network.

    <br>
    All relevant information, including real-time location data with timestamps, is communicated via the Internet and
    monitored by a supervising body to prevent inaccuracies. This transparency enhances accountability and ensures the
    effective execution of the proposed measures.
    <br>
    <br>
    By providing passengers with real-time location data through the internet, the solution enhances user experience,
    reducing wait times and offering visibility into the arrival times of subsequent vehicles. Overall, this
    comprehensive approach not only addresses the identified problems but aligns with Industry 4.0 principles,
    showcasing the transformative potential of IoT in optimizing public transportation for efficiency, responsiveness,
    and passenger satisfaction

<h2>Uniqueness of the Solution</h2>
<p class="desc-2"> -->
    The proposed solution differs from existing products, such as those using RFID technology or dynamic scheduling, by
    uniquely addressing both peak and non-peak drives. Unlike other solutions that focus on tracking arrivals or
    adjusting schedules based on unexpected events, our product dynamically adjusts vehicle speeds in response to the
    number of passengers on board and waiting.
    <br>
    <br>
    A key distinction is our real-time responsiveness to passenger demand, considering both current passenger counts and
    those waiting at stops. This ensures optimal vehicle utilization, preventing overloading during peak hours and
    improving efficiency during non-peak timesâ€”a feature not present in other solutions.
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, our decentralized decision-making empowers individual vehicles to make real-time adjustments,
    enhancing adaptability and responsiveness. The solution's primary focus on reducing overall time wasted in
    transportation sets it apart, providing a user-centric approach to public transportation optimization.
