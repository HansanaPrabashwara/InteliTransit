    In our proposed public transportation solution, IoT (Internet of Things) serves as a foundational technology to
    enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of the entire system. The IoT devices embedded in each public vehicle,
    including cameras, sensors, and communication modules, enable real-time data collection and sharing.
