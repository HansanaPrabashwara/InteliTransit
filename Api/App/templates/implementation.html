<p class="desc-2">
    The proposed product features a compact processing unit equipped with essential components, including inbuilt Wi-Fi,
    a location tracker, an acceleration sensor, a real-time clock, a display, tilt sensors, buttons, and cameras. The
    cameras, strategically mounted on the vehicle doors, will accurately count passengers entering and exiting at each
    stop.

    The system logs data such as acceleration, time, and connection status, which is then transmitted via Wi-Fi to the
    central unit. The central unit aggregates data from all vehicles on the route, facilitating real-time communication
    and coordination. Using this collective data, the system recalculates optimal speeds for each vehicle, displaying
    the information on the driver's interface.

    Additionally, the product includes an emergency button for drivers to instantly inform the central unit of
    emergencies or breakdowns. The tilt sensor sends a signal to the central unit if tilting is detected, providing an
    added layer of safety monitoring. This comprehensive set of features enhances real-time responsiveness,
    coordination, and safety, contributing to the overall efficiency of the public transportation system

<h2>User Scenario</h2>
<p class="desc-2">
    This innovative product caters to three distinct user aspects, offering tailored functionalities for each user
    group. For the driver, a display featuring maximum and minimum speed limits ensures adherence to speed regulations,
    optimizing the safety and efficiency of the vehicle. Passengers benefit from reduced wait times through the ability
    to inform the public vehicle of their presence, particularly useful during peak hours. The administration, equipped
    with tools to locate and monitor vehicles, gains the ability to make informed decisions.

    In the system's operational scenario, all vehicles initially follow a base schedule. As a vehicle accumulates a
    higher passenger count, it autonomously increases its speed, optimizing efficiency. Once the passenger limit is
    reached, the subsequent vehicle in line adjusts its speed to pick up additional passengers at stops. Speed is
    further influenced by the number of waiting passengers, ensuring a responsive system. Conversely, if a vehicle has
    insufficient passengers, it slows down, and after reaching a certain threshold, the subsequent vehicle also adjusts
    its speed accordingly. This dynamic approach effectively addresses both peak and non-peak passenger issues,
    providing an adaptive and efficient public transportation experience. The integration of real-time location data and
    passenger-initiated notifications significantly reduces wait times for passengers, contributing to an overall
    improvement in the efficiency and responsiveness of the transportation system.
